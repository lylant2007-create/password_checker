# 🔐 Password Strength Checker

> **Have you ever wondered whether your password is strong or weak?**
> This is a Python-based tool designed to analyze password security based on length, character types, and complexity.

### 👩‍💻 For Developers (Source Code)
Check out the **Python logic** to see how I implemented the security algorithms using Regex and Tkinter.
- Navigate to the `python file` folder.
- Look for `check_password.py`.

### 🎀 For Users (App)
Download the **runnable .exe app** to use the tool immediately (No Python installation needed!).
- Navigate to the `exe file` folder.
- Download and run `PasswordChecker.exe`.

## 🛠️ How I Built This
To create a tool that is both **secure** and **user-friendly**, I combined my coding logic with AI assistance:

* **Core Logic (Algorithm):** I developed the password analysis algorithm using **Python** (evaluating length, lower/upper case, digits, and special characters).
* **User Interface (GUI):** To make the tool accessible and fun (especially for non-tech users), I utilized **Generative AI** to help design the "Pink Theme" interface using the `Tkinter` library.
